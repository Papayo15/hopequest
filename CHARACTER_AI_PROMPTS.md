## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Generate in batches**: Do all Marco poses, then Luis, etc.
2. **Keep prompt consistent**: Use similar wording for character consistency
3. **Iterate**: Start with one character, get it perfect, then apply learnings to others
4. **Save everything**: Even "bad" generations might have usable elements
5. **Mix and match**: Use Photoshop/GIMP to combine best parts from multiple generations

## 🚀 Next Steps After Concept Art

Once you have concept art:
1. Create sprite sheets using **Piskel** (free) or **Aseprite** ($20)
2. Animate walk cycles, jumps, special abilities
3. Export as PNG sequences or atlas sheets
4. Integrate into React Native game

**Budget**: $0 (using free AI tools + free sprite editors)
**Time**: 1-2 weeks (including iterations and sprite sheet creation)
**Result**: Professional Pixar-style characters ready for implementation
